# MessageQ for Mac

Have you ever wanted to send a message to somebody, but realized it is 3am and you will seem like a total weirdo if you went ahead and sent it?

MessageQ was created just for that. It will let you schedule, cancel and queue messages to be sent at the time you need them to be. No more worrying your friends and family.

# Prerequisites

A Messages.app that is authenticated with your iCloud information, ideally set up with your phone number. Information on how to set that up can be found here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202549

# Install

TBD
