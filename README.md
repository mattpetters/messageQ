# MessageQueue for Mac

Have you ever wanted to send a message to somebody, but realized it is 3am and you will seem like a total weirdo if you went ahead and sent it?

MessageQueue was created just for that. You can now schedule, cancel and queue messages to be sent at the time you need them to be. No more worrying your friends and family.
